* Error testing: nxdomain, nodata, servfail etc?
* Create proper response dictionary structure?
* Support extensions (probably after DNSSEC support, because a lot of
  the extensions are related to DNSSEC).
* Support multiple upstream servers
* Implement Iterative resolution
* DNSSEC validation
* Implement async functions? 
  Or delegate to Go programmer using goroutines & channels?
